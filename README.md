        *Windows users with active antivirus must allow the execution of the file somehow or temporarily disable the antivirus, or add the executable file to the antivirus exception list;
        *Linux users must give permission to execute the file through the terminal with the command: chmod +x "file name"
        **As noted in project discussion, pyinstaller has problems to execute normally because of being blacklisted by most antivirus, even though the executable is clean, so it is necessary to disable the antivirus or add the executable to the exception list.
            ***feel free to send a message or open an issue if you have any problem with the executable file, I will be happy to help. Thank you for reading.
